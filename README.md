# Worcester-Bus-Travel-Time-Prediction-Model
The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model to predict actual WRTA bus travel time between stops using historical data. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and comparing Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with Random Forest achieving the best performance.
